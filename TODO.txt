MUST:
- high level strategy for the droid
    - automatically taking actions
- make placing settlement smarter
    - include ports
    - think about obtaining all resources
    - be smarter about building first road

WOULD BE NICE:
- only show possible road/settlement placements
- fix undo / remove it
    - right now, undoing does not change cards in hand, so undoing placing a settlement won't give the cards back
- only allow stealing from players with cards
