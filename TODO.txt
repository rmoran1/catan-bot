MUST:
- implement robber stealing
- implement hand loss w/ 7 roll
- implement development cards
    - playing knights, monopoly, VP, year of plenty, road building
- implement largest army & longest road
- high level strategy for the droid
    - automatically taking actions
- make placing settlement smarter
    - include ports
    - think about obtaining all resources
    - be smarter about building first road
- implement victory point count

WOULD BE NICE:
- only show possible road/settlement placements
- fix undo / remove it
    - right now, undoing does not change cards in hand, so undoing placing a settlement won't give the cards back
- fix weird placement bug (sometimes, clicking a road/settlement in initial phase throws a TypeError, but it works when clicking it again)
