MUST:
- implement robber
- implement hand loss w/ 7 roll
- implement development cards
- implement largest army & longest road
- high level strategy for the droid
    - automatically taking actions
- make placing settlement smarter
    - include ports
    - think about obtaining all resources
    - be smarter about building first road
- implement port trading (both 3:1 and 2:1)
- implement player trading

WOULD BE NICE:
- only show possible road/settlement placements
- update display of hands immediately after purchase, not only on turn change
- fix undo / remove it
    - right now, undoing does not change cards in hand
- fix weird placement bug (sometimes, clicking a road/settlement in initial phase throws a TypeError, but it works when clicking it again)
