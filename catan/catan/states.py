"""
module states provides catan state machines which semi-correctly implement the State Pattern

State Pattern: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern

The Game has a state whose type is one of the GameState types defined in this module.
The Game has a dev card state whose type is one of the DevCardPlayabilityState types defined in this module.
The Board has a state whose type is one of the BoardState types defined in this module.

Each state machine is described in base state's docstring.

Actions
-------

Callers should invoke action methods on the object directly, and the object will delegate
actions to its state as necessary.

e.g.
    # class Game
    def steal(self, victim):
        if victim is None:
            victim = Player(1, 'nobody', 'nobody')
        self.state.steal(victim)
    # class GameStateSteal
    def steal(self, victim):
        self.game.catanlog.log_robber(
            self.game.get_cur_player(),
            self.game.robber_tile,
            victim
        )
        self.game.set_state(GameStateDuringTurnAfterRoll(self.game))
    # class GameStateStealUsingKnight
    def steal(self, victim):
        self.game.catanlog.log_plays_dev_knight(
            self.game.get_cur_player(),
            self.game.robber_tile,
            victim
        )
        self.game.set_state(GameStateDuringTurnAfterRoll(self.game))

State Capabilities
------------------

Callers should query state capabilities through the state.

e.g.
    if game.state.can_trade():
        tradingUI.show()
    else:
        tradingUI.hide()

Any new state capabilities must be named like can_do_xyz() and must return True or False.
When a GameState subclass doesn't implement can_do_xyz2(), the method call will be caught in
GameState.__getattr__. The method call will be ignored and None will be returned instead.

If the method does not look like can_do_xyz(), it will be logged.
